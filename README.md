The Project
Project Title
"Energy Consumption Benchmark: A Web Service for Energy Consumption Monitoring"
Introduction
In this project, we'll embark on creating Energy Consumption Benchmark, a cutting-edge web service designed to monitor and analyze energy consumption from various devices. As the world moves towards sustainability, understanding and optimizing energy use has never been more important. Energy Consumption Benchmark aims to empower users by providing real-time data and insights into their energy consumption patterns, encouraging informed decisions towards energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.
Project Overview
Energy Consumption Benchmark is a comprehensive platform that allows users to register their electrical devices, track energy consumption, and gain valuable insights into how to reduce their energy footprint. Utilizing Node.js for our backend and a modern, responsive frontend, we'll create a user-friendly web service accessible from various devices.
Project Objectives
•	Develop a Full-Stack Web Service: Learn the intricacies of full-stack development using Node.js, Express, and Tailwind CSS / Flowbite.
•	Implement Real-Time Data Processing: Handle live data feeds of energy consumption, simulating real-world IoT data handling.
•	Create a User-Centric Design: Focus on usability and user experience, ensuring our service is accessible and easy to use.
Project Components
1.	Backend Development: Using Node.js and Express, create a robust API that handles user management, device registration, and data processing.
2.	Frontend Development: Design an intuitive and responsive user interface with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS / flowbit) and JavaScript.
3.	Database Management: Design and implement a MySQL database schema for storing user data, device information, and energy consumption records.
4.	Data Visualization: Implement interactive charts and reports for users to understand their energy consumption patterns.
5.	Security: Ensure the application's security through proper authentication, authorization, and data validation techniques.
