                                        <p>Wikipedia defines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterbox" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letterboxing</a> as the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the original aspect ratio. Generally this is accomplished by adding mattes (or ‘black bars’) above and below the picture area. Letterboxd is named for our love of the widescreen format, and has nothing whatsoever to do with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">orienteering</a> or that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxYq0FvBo5M" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thing in <em>Stand By Me</em></a>.

                                        <h1 id="use-of-service">How should I use Letterboxd?</h1>
                                        <p>Short answer: however you like. We invite new members to read our <a href="https://letterboxd.com/welcome/">Welcome page</a>, which covers a number of common actions and helpful tips. The easiest interaction is to mark films you’ve seen using the ‘eye’ icon on each poster. You can rate films and perform other actions from the Actions menu on the poster as well. Each film you mark as watched is added to your profile, allowing others to see what you’ve watched, and the site to optionally hide films we know you’ve seen when browsing some pages.</p>
        <p>Use the ‘+ Log’ button in the website header or the ‘+’ button in our apps to log a film, including the date you watched it and an optional review. Do this as you watch films (to populate your Diary) or to share your opinion of a film you’ve seen in the past (providing a watched date is optional). When logging/reviewing a film, you can also rate and/or like it, and add tags (for the film itself or to remind you how/with whom you watched it). We provide easy tools for making and sharing lists/collections of films too.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>No, we are not a streaming service, but we do link to films on other services.</p>

                                        <h1 id="watched-vs-logged">What’s the difference between marking a film watched and logging it?</h1>
                                        <p>Marking a film as ‘watched’ (using the ‘eye’ icon on the film’s poster or controls, or by rating the film if you haven’t already marked it as watched) tells Letterboxd you’ve seen the film at some point in the past. It’s the best way to ‘back-fill’ films on the service, without having to recall exactly when you watched them. Marking films ‘watched’ adds to your overall tally of films, is useful when browsing lists (we show the percentage of each list you’ve watched) and allows you to optionally hide the films you’ve seen when browsing some&nbsp;screens.</p>
        <p class="js-hide-in-app">Logging a film (via the ‘+ Log’ button) allows you to record that you watched a film on a particular date. Adding films in this manner builds up your Diary (a record of when you saw each film) and the Recent Activity section of your Profile—films are also marked as watched when you log them, if that flag is not already set. A minimum of ten diary entries in a given year is required to generate a Year in Review page (<a href="/about/pro/">Pro</a> members only), or the email summary that we send in January (to all members who choose to receive our general news emails). Most members keep an up-to-date Diary only from the time they join the site, but it is possible to <a href="https://letterboxd.com/about/importing/">import</a> your viewing history if you have that data from another app or spreadsheet.</p>
        
                                    </li>

                                        <h1 id="remove-from-watched">Can I remove a film from my watched list?</h1>
                                        <p>Yes, you can unmark a film as watched by clicking the green “eye” icon to toggle it off, but you’ll need to remove any diary entries or reviews for the film, as well as its rating (this can be removed on the film’s page).</p>

                                        <p class="js-hide-in-app">You can retrospectively add diary entries for films you’ve marked as watched, in order to complete your Diary. If you need the activity dates for when you marked each film, these are included in your account export bundle, which you can download in <a href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/">Settings</a>. (If you’d like to automate this process and you know your way around a computer, grab the relevant CSV file from the export bundle, rename the <code>Date</code> column to <code>Watched Date</code>, and then use our <a rel="noopener" href="https://letterboxd.com/import/" target="_blank">importer</a> to add the diary entries to your account—you’ll have the chance to check them before they’re finalized.)</p>

                                        <h1 id="like-vs-rate">What’s the difference between liking and rating a film?</h1>
                                        <p>You can ‘like’ a film any time to show you enjoyed it, which builds up your Profile and Likes pages, or rate films (via the film’s page, or by logging it, or using the Actions menu on any poster) to give your friends a better idea of how much you loved (or hated) it, and they’ll see this on your Ratings page and in their activity feed (if it’s part of a review or diary entry). If you provide ratings for films, you can later sort films by these ratings, useful for making year-end lists. It’s no problem to use both ratings and likes (or neither).</p>

                                        <p>Yes. You may edit a diary entry and/or add a review at any time after logging a film. Go to the diary entry (from the Diary tab in your Films section) and find the option to ‘Add a Review’. Your review will show in your followers’ activity as soon as you save it (if this is the first time you’ve added one), even if your followers already saw activity when you first logged the film.</p>

                                        <h1 id="rating-films">When I rate a film, do all my ratings for it change?</h1>

This allows your rating to change over time, should you log or review a film multiple times, rather than keeping the same rating for the film for all time. Note that each time you add a rating as part of a diary entry/review (or update the rating in an old diary entry/review), your ‘default’ rating for the film is updated to match.</p>

                                        <p>Your ‘Films’ total counts each film <em>once</em> for the period (all time or within a single year), while your ‘Diary Entries’ total counts every individual watch of a film. If you’ve logged any films two or more times within the period, your Diary Entries total will exceed your Films total. (Note that a re-watch will still count towards your ‘Films’ total for the year the&nbsp;<em>first</em> time you watch it during that year, but not on subsequent views.)</p>

                                        <p>Some cast contributions are internally marked as ‘cameo’ roles, for instance if there is no character name associated with the role or it is listed as ‘uncredited’.

                                        <p>While we view the whole of Letterboxd as one big, organic recommendation engine, we don’t have a section specifically labeled as such. You can, however, use our sorting and filters to find films that may be of interest. For example, <a rel="noopener" href="https://letterboxd.com/films/by/your-interest-liked/?filters=hide-watched" target="_blank">this page</a>&nbsp;shows a selection of films you haven’t seen, based on your watched and liked films (you’ll need to use the ‘heart’ icon on a few films to get meaningful results, as this method doesn’t consider your ratings). Many films also have a ‘Similar Films’ list; tapping through to see all similar films for a given title surfaces the themes and ‘nanogenres’ for that title, another great way to discover new films to watch based on your particular areas of interest.</p>

                                        <p>There are a couple reasons why an unavailable username may not have a corresponding profile: we reserve some usernames for our own future possible use; and there are also a number of deactivated accounts that still have their original username attached.

                                        <p>Not necessarily. We have a single username space across all global territories, offered on a first-come, first-served basis.

By default anyone can comment on your reviews and lists, but you can update your <a href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/">settings</a> to allow only people you follow to comment, or disable others from commenting at all. You can override your profile default on any individual comment thread if you wish, for example to close comments on a single review but leave others open to replies.</p>
        <p>In addition, as a content owner you can also delete comments made by other members on <em>your</em> reviews and lists, and (if you need to) you can <a href="#blocking-members">block</a> them from commenting on your content in future.</p>

                                        <p>Yes. The following filters on our website allow members to reduce the set of films shown, both in their own profile and around the site. Use the grey “eye” icon at the top of a poster grid to access the Filters menu (a slash through the icon indicates that one or more filters are active). Some filters are automatically disabled when redundant; for example, you can’t show or hide watched films when looking at your own list of films (by definition, the&nbsp;list of films on your profile is <em>already</em> your watched films).</p>

                                        <p>Letterboxd works like X/Twitter: when you follow other people, you’ll see the films they add or review, the stuff they like, and the comments they make on your other friends’ stuff, appear in your <a href="https://letterboxd.com/activity/">Activity</a> timeline and elsewhere. Members you select to follow are referred to as your ‘friends’ on the platform.</p>

                                        <p>Yes. Use the flag icon on a member’s profile or comment to block or report them (in our apps, go to their profile screen and open the action sheet from the more-options icon). When you block a member, the follower relationship is terminated in both directions, comments they’ve posted on <em>your</em> reviews and lists are hidden for everyone who visits those pages, and their avatar and content (including comments they’ve posted elsewhere) is hidden for you. The blocked member is also prevented from replying to (or liking) any of your content, and you won’t see activity relating to them in your feed.</p>
        <p>If you feel that a member’s content is generally inappropriate or otherwise contravenes our <a href="/legal/community-policy/">Community Policy</a>, we encourage you to report the content via the flag icon, in addition to blocking them.</p>
        <p>Blocking a member does <em>not</em> hide your content from them, as Letterboxd does not have private accounts, which would be required to protect your content in this way.</p>

                                        <p>At Letterboxd, we strive to create an open, inclusive space for all film lovers, including members from communities that have too often been marginalized or been the recipients of hateful rhetoric. As a result, we moderate with that sensitivity in mind. We have zero tolerance for overt or coded hate speech, racism, white supremacy, homophobia, transphobia or any communication that intends to harm or marginalize a particular group or individual based on any protected attribute (as described <a href="/legal/community-policy/">here</a>).</p>
        <p><span>Our moderators will remove content that appears to violate or undermine these principles. However, we also acknowledge that we are human, and that o</span><span>ur moderation team cannot begin to grasp or encompass the full spectrum of humanity and lived experiences that comprise our wonderful community. We may misinterpret or misunderstand your intent. In our sincere desire to foster inclusiveness, we may inadvertently silence the very voices we most want to hear from.</span></p>
        <p>If your content has been removed and you believe we were in error, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a> with all relevant details. Our support crew will let you know if specific changes might result in the reinstatement of your content. We all benefit when we have the opportunity to learn and better understand one another.</p>

                                        <p>We support a limited set of HTML tags on our website for formatting and linking to other content. These are: <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> tags for <strong>bold</strong> text, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags for <em>italics</em>, <code>&lt;a href="[URL]"&gt;</code> for <a href="https://letterboxd.com" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">links</a> and <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tags for quoting others.</p>
        <p>For all of these tags, place an opening tag (eg. <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>) and its corresponding closing tag (eg. <code>&lt;/strong&gt;</code>) on either side of the content you’d like to format. For links, include the URL to link to as the <code>href</code> parameter, and ensure it is surrounded by straight quotes (<code>"</code>) rather than smart or curly quotes.</p>
        <p>Our native apps provide toolbar buttons for applying formatting while editing content.</p>

                                        <p>When logging diary entries for films you watched more than two weeks in the past, we show your followers a maximum of one item per hour, to prevent this activity from saturating their feeds. To avoid followers missing your updates, log watched films in a timely fashion, and add your review later—your review will show in your friends’ activity the first time you save the diary entry with review text.</p>

                                        <p>We’d prefer you didn’t. Letterboxd is for reviews of films you’ve seen, not those you want to see. Feel free to use the Report function (flag icon) to alert us to any trailer or other pre-release reviews, which we’ll remove at our discretion.</p>

                                        <p>Yes. There is an Edit option on each of your reviews and lists. On the web, this option appears in the actions panel on the relevant page. In edit mode, you can make changes to your content and save these to replace the previous version. Older revisions of reviews and lists are not stored when you make updates, so it is not possible to restore an older version. Edit mode also provides a Delete option to remove the review or list.</p>
        <p>In our apps, the Edit and Delete options are in the actions menu available from the title bar of a review or list.</p>

                                        <p>Yes. Your <a href="/settings/data/">account export bundle</a> includes all of your deleted content in CSV format. You can retrieve and repost (or import) deleted reviews and lists from your bundle. Starting 1&nbsp;May 2024, any content you delete will remain in your bundle for <a href="/about/faq/#deleted-content">30 days following its deletion</a>, after which time it will be permanently removed from our servers.</p>

                                        <p>You can tag films (when adding them to your diary) and curated lists. Use tags as you would on a blog or X/Twitter, to add context to your content. Tags may reflect your own genre taxonomy, an occasion or festival, where/how/with whom you saw a film, the type or style of a list, or anything else you care to use them for. Each diary entry or curated list displays its list of keyword tags, which you can use to cross-reference your own content, your friends’ content, or community-wide.</p>

                                        <h1 id="unicode-tags">Can I use unicode tags?</h1>
                                        <p>Yes. We support unicode characters in tags and tag URLs. If you mix unicode and latin characters in a single tag, only the latin characters will be used to generate the tag URL, which may cause multiple tags to ‘collapse’ into a single tag for purposes of aggregation.</p>

                                        <p>Yes, <a rel="noopener" href="https://letterboxd.com/pro/" target="_blank">paying subscribers</a> can rename and delete tags across all of their diary entries, reviews and lists, from their main Tags page on our desktop website (app support will be added in a future update). Place your pointer over any tag to reveal the Edit and Delete icons. The Edit option lets you rename a single tag across all your tagged content, and can be used to merge two tags (by renaming one tag to the same name as another of your tags)—you’ll be warned if editing a tag will result in a merge, and given the option to cancel or proceed. The Delete option removes a tag from all your tagged content. <em>There is no undo for these actions, so please be careful!</em></p>

                                        <p>With lists, you can collect and share groups of films (or keep private lists for yourself). All Letterboxd members have a watchlist to collect films they’d like to see. Create as many curated lists as you wish, for favorite genre films, your collection of physical discs, or your <a href="https://letterboxd.com/matthew/list/stealing-beauty/">favorite heist films</a>.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>Your watchlist is where you keep track of films you’d like to watch. It doesn’t have an edit page, but it does have a single-click add/remove toggle on a film’s page (the clock icon), and from the ‘More Options’ menu on any film poster. Films in your watchlist are automatically removed when you mark them as watched, or log, review or rate them. Just like curated lists, you can set your watchlist to be visible to others or private.</p>
        <p>When signed in and browsing films on the Letterboxd website (with a non-touch-based device), those that are in your watchlist show with a blue outline when your pointer is placed over the poster, as opposed to the regular green outline.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>Yes. Visit the other member’s watchlist and filter by ‘In your watchlist’ (to show films you both want to see) or ‘Hide watched films’ (to show films you haven’t seen)—or both! These filters are located in the menu attached to the ‘eye’ icon above the watchlist posters (and in the filters page in our iOS app).</p>

                                        <p>Yes. When editing a list on our website, temporarily enable the Ranked List option if it’s not already checked. With this option active, you can click the list position of any film, type in a new position and press Return on your keyboard. The film will move to the new position, and the remaining films in your list will be renumbered accordingly. Once the list is in your desired order, remember to disable the Ranked List option prior to saving (for lists that aren’t ranked).</p>
        <p>The list editor also offers a Sort By control that can be used to change the current order of the list prior to saving, based on metadata associated with each film (such as its title or your rating). Note: this option changes the actual order of items in the list, and does not change the default sort order for anyone viewing the list (at present there is no way to change the <em>default</em> viewing mode for a list).</p>
        <p>Our apps offer similar reordering options—tap a row in the list while in edit mode to edit its notes and change its position in the list.</p>

                                        <p>We support a special tag to denote digital or physical ownership of films for <a href="/pro/">paid members</a>. Tag one or more of your (public or private) lists with <code>own</code> or <code>owned</code> to indicate you own the films included in the list(s), and two new filters will appear in the Filters menu on most list or grid pages on our website, and in the Filters screen in our apps. These filters let you show or hide films you own while viewing the content in question, and can be used in conjunction with our streaming availability filters. You’ll also see an indication if you own the film in the Where to Watch panel for each film on our website (we’ll bring that to our apps soon).</p>

                                        <h2 class="section-heading">Film posters</h2>
                                        <h1 id="custom-posters">Can I change the poster for a film?</h1>
                                        <p>Yes, if you have a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pro/">Patron</a> (or HQ) subscription, you’ll see a <em>Change Poster</em> option for each film. In our apps, this is in the film’s action sheet, and on our website it’s on the film’s main page and also in the fly-out menu on its poster. Selecting this option opens a modal dialog with three tabs: <em>Popular</em>, <em>TMDb</em> and <em>Posteritati</em>. You may select replacement art for the film from any tab by clicking/tapping the desired poster, then saving changes. The poster you select will represent the film for your use of the platform on both app and web, as described below.</p>
        <p>If your subscription level gives access to the custom-poster option, you’ll see four modes available in Settings (and replicated in the Filters menu for ease of access) that govern which poster you see for each film:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Any</strong>: your selection is shown <em>unless</em> you’re viewing the profile or content of another member with a custom selection for the film, in which case their poster takes priority over yours (this is the default mode)</li>
        <li><strong>Theirs</strong>: the profile or content owner’s selection is always shown when applicable, with your selections shown otherwise</li>
        <li><strong>Yours</strong>: your selection is <em>always</em> shown, including on other members’ content</li>
        <li><strong>None</strong>: the feature is disabled and our platform-default poster is always shown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you <em>do not</em> have access to the custom-poster option, there are two modes that govern which poster you see for each film:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Enabled</strong>: when viewing the profile or content of a member with a custom selection for the film, their poster is shown (this is the default mode)</li>
        <li><strong>Disabled</strong>: the platform-default poster is always shown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We support one custom poster per film for each Patron/HQ member, and you may change your selection as often as you wish. The posters offered are sourced from <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org" target="_blank">TMDb</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://posteritati.com" target="_blank">Posteritati</a>, and there is no option to load your own poster directly to Letterboxd. TMDb accepts user submissions, but please follow <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/bible/image/59f7582c9251416e7100005f" target="_blank">the published guidelines</a> when uploading posters to its platform, as abuse of these rules may lead to the feature being suspended on your account. TMDb submissions can take up to seven hours to appear on Letterboxd due to caching at their end.</p>
        <p><em>Note: some views on our website may show an older poster selection for another member due to caching—our caches are cleared in all cases within 24 hours, after which time you’ll see the correct selection.</em></p>
                                    </li>
                                
                                    <li class="js-filter-listitem">
                                        
                                        <h1 id="custom-poster-single">Can I change a film poster in just one of my lists?</h1>
                                        <p>Yes. By default, poster changes apply platform-wide (as described above) but single-list changes are also possible. When viewing a list you own, use the <em>Change Poster</em> option on a film’s poster (or in the list’s Details view on mobile web), and enable the <em>This list only</em> checkbox before saving your new selection. The new poster will appear for you (and visitors to your profile and content) in just this one list. Support for this feature is web-only for now, with app support coming in a future update.</p>
        <p>Resetting the poster for the film <strong>outside</strong> of the list in question will not affect any custom-poster selections made in other lists. To remove an individually customized poster, return to the relevant list and use the <em>Reset for List</em>&nbsp;button in the <em>Change Poster</em> modal (the <em>This list only</em> option will be checked, indicating the poster is customized specifically for this list), then select <em>Save for List</em>.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h1 id="reset-custom-poster">Can I undo a custom-poster selection?</h1>
                                        <p>Yes, there is a <em>Reset Poster</em> option in the selection dialog for each film, which reverts your account back to the platform-default poster. This approach is preferred over manually selecting the platform-default poster, as that action still counts as a customization, and your selection won’t change if our default poster for the film is changed in future. (In situations where our default poster for a given film is no longer available on TMDb—and is therefore not shown as an option in the selection dialog—the only way to restore that selection is via the <em>Reset Poster</em> option.)</p>
        <p>The&nbsp;<em>Reset Poster</em> option does not remove cutomizations made inside individual lists (see above). To reset these selections, you must individually edit each list and remove the relevant customized poster(s).</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h1 id="poster-filter">How do I see all the posters I’ve customized?</h1>
                                        <p>We’ve added <em>Show/hide films you’ve customized&nbsp;</em>filters on the web and in our apps. Apply the <em>Show</em> version of this&nbsp;filter to your own watched films, or to all films (from the Browse tab/main Films section) to see your full list of customizations.</p>
        <p>The above-mentioned filter <em>does not</em> show films that have been individually customized within a single list (see above). The <em>Change Poster</em> modal view on our desktop website includes a link to each of your lists that includes an individually customized poster for the film in question.</p>

                                        <p>If you’re signed in to our website, the hover color on each of our posters indicates one of three states for the film in question:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>White:</strong> you haven’t watched the film</li>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> you have watched the film (this state is triggered when you log, rate, mark as watched or review the film)</li>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> the film is in your watchlist (this state takes precedence over the film’s watched state)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may initially see the default (white) hover state for a watched or watchlisted film if the browser hasn’t received information about your watched state yet (this additional data is requested separately, once the base page is loaded). If you’re not signed in, all of the hover states are green.</p>

                                        <p>If your subscription expires, all stats pages disappear from your account, and you’ll lose access to any Pro- or Patron-level features that were enabled for you, such as the ability to select and filter by your favorite streaming services (including notifications when films arrive on your favorite services) or to clone lists. If you’ve used Pro- or Patron-level features during your subscription period to alter your account (for example, to change your username more frequently than once per year), these changes will remain in place, but you’ll be unable to use the features again until you renew. As a free member you’ll also see third-party advertising in our website and apps.</p>
        <p>If your subscription expires, and you lose your stats pages, you can restore them in full by renewing at any time—nothing is lost that can’t be restored by renewing.</p>

                                        <p>Yes. If you subscribe <strong>via Paddle on our website</strong>, we offer the option to upgrade on the <a rel="noopener" href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/subscriptions/" target="_blank">Manage Subscriptions</a> screen, and tier changes are pro-rated according to the time remaining in the current period. Upgrades to higher tiers can also be <a href="#gift-subscription">given as gifts</a>. (If you wish to downgrade, you’ll need to cancel your subscription, then re-subscribe at the lower tier once the subscription ends.)</p>
        <p>If your subscription is <strong>via our iOS app</strong>, you can upgrade from Pro to Patron from the app’s Settings screen. Apple refunds the unused portion of your Pro fee and charges you for a full year of Patron. (You can also downgrade. There is no refund issued; Apple changes your subscription from Patron to Pro <em>the next time your subscription renews</em>.)</p>
        <p>If your subscription is <strong>via our Android app</strong>, you can upgrade from Pro to Patron from the app’s Settings screen. Google pro-rates the upgrade fee based on the time remaining on your subscription.</p>

Look for the ‘kebab’ menu (three vertical dots) to the right-hand side of your active subscription, then select the ‘Transfer Subscription’ option and follow the directions. You may not transfer a subscription to an account that already has an active subscription, and you must transfer <em>before</em> you deactivate an account. We require you to enter the password for both accounts, because this mechanism transfers the payment authority to the new account, including the ability to upgrade and/or change the stored payment details.

Gifting is now built into our subscription process, so head to our <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pro/">Pro page</a>, select&nbsp;the ‘Give as a Gift’ option and follow the instructions to nominate a recipient and complete payment.</p>
        <p>When you gift a subscription, the payment authority for the subscription remains with you (meaning you can cancel or change your payment details at any time), but the member benefits are applied to another nominated account. If you gift a higher-tier (e.g. Patron) subscription to a lower-tier member (e.g. Pro) who is in the 90-day expiration window, the remaining days on their subscription are upgraded to the higher&nbsp;tier.</p>
        <p>If you’ve bought a gift subscription for another member, you can manage or cancel it from your <a rel="noopener" href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/subscriptions/" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> dashboard.</p>
        <p>If you wish to gift a subscription to an Apple/iOS subscriber, please consider buying them an <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gift-cards/itunes-electronic" target="_blank">App Store gift&nbsp;card</a>.</p>

        <ul>

                                        <p>Yes, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pro/">paying members</a> have the option of being notified (once per day via email and/or push notification) if a film in their watchlist arrives on one (or more) of their <a href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/stores/">favorite streaming services</a>. You must have at least one favorite service selected, and at least one relevant film in your watchlist in order to receive this type of notification.</p>
        <p>The notification settings are split into three tiers, based on the type of new availability: i.e. whether the film is available to buy, rent or stream. We do our best to combine push notifications into a single alert, where it makes sense (for example, when a single film arrives on multiple services).</p>
        <p>Watchlist alerts are powered by data from <a rel="noopener" href="https://justwatch.com" target="_blank">JustWatch</a>, and may lag updates to its service by up to 24 hours. Because we receive updates once new films are available, we are unable to offer alerts when films are due to&nbsp;<em>leave</em> their respective services (we aren’t warned ahead of time for removals).</p>

                                        <p>There are several reasons why email might not arrive, but the most common is due to failed email authentication. Letterboxd uses technologies (including Sender Policy Framework or SPF) to ensure that only we are legitimately able to send email from the <em>letterboxd.com</em> domain. Most large email providers respect SPF headers, and refuse to deliver email that did not originate from our servers. If you have configured an address to “forward” mail on your behalf (say, from iCloud to Hotmail, or similar), the receiving party may reject the email as it has come from the forwarding party, rather than directly from Letterboxd. The solution is to change the email address on your Letterboxd profile to the final receiving address (in this example, your Hotmail account), thus avoiding the forwarding step.</p>

                                        <h1 id="average-rating">How is the average rating calculated for a film?</h1>
                                        <p>We use a weighted calculation to compute the average rating for each film, rather than using the true mean value of all the ratings cast. Only one rating is considered per member (this is the most recent rating cast by the member for the film).</p>
        <p>The ‘weighted’ part of the calculation refers to the mechanism we use to compute the average rating. <span>Every rating cast after a film’s release is considered, with weightings applied based on the number or ratings received for the film, and other heuristics. For example, a film with only a handful of five-star ratings has its average weighted down to account for its lower volume of ratings compared to a film with tens or hundreds of thousands of ratings. Our approach also identifies unusual patterns of rating activity, and accounts for these in the final score. We do not disclose the specifics of our approach to protect its integrity.</span></p>

                                        <p>Our weighted-average calculations are formulated to reduce the effects of unusual rating patterns, and to accurately represent the global consensus for each film. We do not disclose the specific details of this approach in order to protect its integrity, and we may make changes to the approach from time to time, to ensure its effectiveness. While you’re welcome to report a member who has, for example, cast a single five-star (or half-star) vote for a particular film as part of an online campaign, our approach is designed to ensure that such ratings have no bearing on the film’s weighted average.</p>

                                        <p>Yes. Importing is free for all members, and there are three ways to import:</p>
        <ol>
        <li class="js-hide-in-app">Use the ‘Import your data’ link in <a href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/">Settings</a> (also available <a href="https://letterboxd.com/import/">here</a>) to import films, ratings, diary entries, reviews and more into your account using the <a href="/about/importing-data/">Letterboxd CSV format</a>. Our importer is compatible with the export format used by IMDb, and can be made to work with other export files by editing the column headers in those files to match the ones we expect.</li>
        
        <li>Import directly to a list using the above CSV approach, with support for both IMDb and Delicious Library formats (you’ll need to use their export functions first, see below).</li>
        <li>Import directly to your watchlist using the above CSV approach.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When performing an import, you’ll be able to check and fix any mis-matched titles before confirming the changes, and to select relevant options depending upon import type, such as whether you’d like all imported titles to be marked as watched, or all existing titles in a list to be removed first, as part of the process.</p>
        <p>To export a list from IMDb, go to your <a href="https://www.imdb.com/profile/lists" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lists</a> page, find and open the specific list, scroll to the bottom and click ‘Export this list’. You’ll receive a CSV file which you can import via the edit page of an existing list, or as part of <a href="https://letterboxd.com/list/new/">creating a new list</a>. For more information, see our <a href="/about/migrating-from-imdb/">Migrating from IMDb</a> guide.</p>
        <p>To export from Delicious Library (version 2 or 3), use the <em>File &gt; Export &gt; Export to Another Application…</em> option. Select the shelf or library to export, select the ‘XML’ output format, and click ‘Export…’ to select the output file name and location. You’ll receive an XML file which you can import via the edit page of an existing list, or when <a href="https://letterboxd.com/list/new/">creating a new list</a>.</p>
        <p>Netflix no longer provides an API to directly import your viewing history, but there are user scripts <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/32964" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like this one</a> that could be made to work with the CSV import facility described above.</p>

                                        <p>We display the earliest-known release date for each film (according to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org" target="_blank">TMDb</a>), including premieres and festival screenings.

                                        <p>To maintain a consistent user experience, we lock the posters of popular films from being updated once they are released. If you spot a released film with an incorrect or inferior poster, please <a href="/contact/">let us know</a> and we’ll consider updating it (due to the volume of requests we are not able to respond individually to poster requests). Posters for unreleased films are updated regularly based on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org" target="_blank">TMDb</a> user votes.</p>

                                        <p>We import all non-compilation titles and <a href="/adult-titles/">some adult titles</a> from <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org" target="_blank">TMDb</a>’s Movies section daily, and we manually add limited and miniseries from its TV section. If a film has not been imported, chances are it’s marked as ‘Video’ or is a TV entry, or it is marked as ‘Adult’ but doesn’t meet our criteria for import. The Video tag on TMDb is <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/editing/videos" target="_blank">mostly for compilations</a> (such as collections of exercise or music videos) and the Adult tag is for pornographic material. We <em>do</em> import entries marked ‘Video’ if they have a theatrical release date listed. If an entry has been miscategorized according to TMDb’s <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/bible" target="_blank">guidelines</a>, change the appropriate setting at TMDb and we’ll restore the film on our next scheduled import (TMDb’s API has a six-hour cache and we import once per day, so the update process may take up to 30 hours).</p>
        <p>If you find a non-compilation or qualifying adult entry on TMDb that doesn’t appear on Letterboxd, please email details (including the TMDb URL) to&nbsp;<span><a href="mailto:data@letterboxd.com">data@letterboxd.com</a></span><script type="text/javascript">/*<![CDATA[*/if (document.getElementById('x-protectfilter-3') != null) { document.getElementById('x-protectfilter-3').innerHTML=function(e){var r='';for(var i=118;i>=0;i-=2){r+=e.charAt(i);}return r;}('\u003eTaF/y\u003ctmoopcx.4drxjowbArcevtHt\u003eealf@Va8tSaYdj\u003e5\"Pm0omcD.6dRxAoXb0rrewtutte\u003clT@raatKa8dd:BomtylgiIaWm9\"2=Tfce@rWhs Yav\u003cV'); document.getElementById('x-protectfilter-3').removeAttribute('id'); }/*]]>*/</script> and request a manual import.</p>

                                        <p>Duplicate film entries are sometimes created in <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org" target="_blank">TMDb</a>, which means they end up on our service as well. If/when the duplicate is removed from TMDb, we retain it as it may have been logged or reviewed by our members. If you spot a duplicate, use the Report function on the film’s page (web and iOS app) and we’ll merge the duplicate(s) into a single entry in our database (we take care to move all member activity related to the duplicate film onto the correct entry). When reporting duplicate entries, please include the URL of the correct entry, as this speeds up the process for our moderators.</p>

                                        <p>Yes. Please use the Report function on a film’s page (web or iOS) to report non-film content such as returning TV series (some exceptions are listed <a href="#tv">below</a>). These will be removed at Letterboxd’s discretion. You may also use the Report function to report inappropriate content throughout the site, including reviews of trailers.</p>

                                        <p>No, we do not support ‘returning’ TV shows. For historic reasons, we support a small selection of television content that was originally <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/editing#television" target="_blank">allowed by TMDb</a> in its Movies section (limited or miniseries, TV movies) as well as some notable exceptions like <em>Black Mirror</em>&nbsp;episodes and shows that were initially marketed as limited series but subsequently given second seasons (like <em>Big Little Lies</em>). TMDb has since moved this content to a new TV section; as a result, some films on Letterboxd link to TV entries instead of movies (so that we continue to receive content updates).</p>
        <p class="js-hide-in-app">We reserve the right to remove television-related content from our service at any time. If we remove content that you have reviewed, your review will disappear from the site, but will always be available in your account export bundle in <a href="https://letterboxd.com/settings/data/">Settings</a>.</p>

                                        <p>This mode is called Carousel view, and is available in our apps when viewing a list or any of the sections in the Search/Browse by tab. Depending on the view you’re in, Carousel view can be launched from an icon (it’s a “coverflow”-style depiction of three posters, with the center poster in front) or from the ellipsis menu if you’re on a list (as “View in Carousel mode”). Carousel mode can be used in conjunction with sorting and filters; for example: engage the <em>Hide watched films</em> filter to skip films you’ve already marked or logged.</p>

                                        <p>No. The most common method used by an attacker to gain access to another person’s account (on any online service that supports sign-ins) is to find the account owner’s credentials in a “data leak” and use them to change the account password and/or delete the account. Data leaks can occur when an online service’s servers or datastore are compromised by an attacker, and the contents published online. The best defense against such an attack is to use unique, complex passwords for each different service you join.</p>
        <p>Letterboxd requires the account password for email address changes and account deactivations, among other actions. If you believe your Letterboxd account has been compromised by an attacker, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a> with us at your earliest convenience and we will do our best to restore access for you.

We are not accepting new content-embed partners at this time. It’s possible we might look at embeddable reviews and/or lists in the future, but this facility is not available today.</p>

The easiest interaction is to mark films you\u2019ve seen using the \u2018eye\u2019 icon on each poster. You can rate films and perform other actions from the Actions menu on the poster as well. Each film you mark as watched is added to your profile, allowing others to see what you\u2019ve watched, and the site to optionally hide films we know you\u2019ve seen when browsing some pages.\r\nUse the \u2018+ Log\u2019 button in the website header or the \u2018+\u2019 button in our apps to log a film, including the date you watched it and an optional review. Do this as you watch films (to populate your Diary) or to share your opinion of a film you\u2019ve seen in the past (providing a watched date is optional). When logging/reviewing a film, you can also rate and/or like it, and add tags (for the film itself or to remind you how/with whom you watched it).

Letterboxd uses technologies (including Sender Policy Framework or SPF) to ensure that only we are legitimately able to send email from the letterboxd.com domain. Most large email providers respect SPF headers, and refuse to deliver email that did not originate from our servers. If you have configured an address to \u201cforward\u201d mail on your behalf (say, from iCloud to Hotmail, or similar), the receiving party may reject the email as it has come from the forwarding party, rather than directly from Letterboxd. The solution is to change the email address on your Letterboxd profile to the final receiving address (in this example, your Hotmail account), thus avoiding the forwarding step."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is the average rating calculated for a film?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We use a weighted calculation to compute the average rating for each film, rather than using the true mean value of all the ratings cast.

Every rating cast after a film\u2019s release is considered, with weightings applied based on the number or ratings received for the film, and other heuristics. For example, a film with only a handful of five-star ratings has its average weighted down to account for its lower volume of ratings compared to a film with tens or hundreds of thousands of ratings. Our approach also identifies unusual patterns of rating activity, and accounts for these in the final score. We do not disclose the specifics of our approach to protect its integrity."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What does Letterboxd do about campaigns designed to manipulate a film\u2019s rating up or down?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our weighted-average calculations are formulated to reduce the effects of unusual rating patterns, and to accurately represent the global consensus for each film.

While you\u2019re welcome to report a member who has, for example, cast a single five-star (or half-star) vote for a particular film as part of an online campaign, our approach is designed to ensure that such ratings have no bearing on the film\u2019s weighted average."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Are my profile, reviews and lists publicly visible?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes (with the exception of any list or watchlist you\u2019ve set as private).

We do import entries marked \u2018Video\u2019 if they have a theatrical release date listed. If an entry has been miscategorized according to TMDb\u2019s guidelines, change the appropriate setting at TMDb and we\u2019ll restore the film on our next scheduled import (TMDb\u2019s API has a six-hour cache and we import once per day, so the update process may take up to 30 hours).\r\nIf you find a non-compilation or qualifying adult entry on TMDb that doesn\u2019t appear on Letterboxd, please email details (including the TMDb URL) to data@letterboxd.com and request a manual import."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I report duplicate films in your database?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Duplicate film entries are sometimes created in TMDb, which means they end up on our service as well. If/when the duplicate is removed from TMDb, we retain it as it may have been logged or reviewed by our members. If you spot a duplicate, use the Report function on the film\u2019s page (web and iOS app) and we\u2019ll merge the duplicate(s) into a single entry in our database (we take care to move all member activity related to the duplicate film onto the correct entry). When reporting duplicate entries, please include the URL of the correct entry, as this speeds up the process for our moderators."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I report non-film content?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Please use the Report function on a film\u2019s page (web or iOS) to report non-film content such as returning TV series (some exceptions are listed below). These will be removed at Letterboxd\u2019s discretion. You may also use the Report function to report inappropriate content throughout the site, including reviews of trailers."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do you support TV shows?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No, we do not support \u2018returning\u2019 TV shows. For historic reasons, we support a small selection of television content that was originally allowed by TMDb in its Movies section (limited or miniseries, TV movies) as well as some notable exceptions like Black Mirror episodes and shows that were initially marketed as limited series but subsequently given second seasons (like Big Little Lies). TMDb has since moved this content to a new TV section; as a result, some films on Letterboxd link to TV entries instead of movies (so that we continue to receive content updates).\r\nWe reserve the right to remove television-related content from our service at any time. If we remove content that you have reviewed, your review will disappear from the site, but will always be available in your account export bundle in Settings.\r\nWe reserve the right to remove television-related content from Letterboxd at any time, without warning.

PPV and similar events are now classified as \u2018Video\u2019 content (a designation mostly used for compilations of content including music and exercise videos), and we do not import such entries. Your reviews for deleted content are included in your account export bundle (available in Settings).\r\nThese were (mostly) removed from the site as the result of a policy change at TMDb.

We have iOS, Android and Apple TV apps that offer a subset of the website\u2019s features. We are working towards the release of a public API and if you have a specific project in mind, you may apply for beta access."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Letterboxd work with Apple\u2019s Shortcuts app?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. We support Siri Shortcuts (look in the Settings screen of our iOS app) as well as x-callback-url for several common actions, which means you can script our app using the Shortcuts app (previously named Workflow). See Github for documentation and sample workflows."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"My Android app won\u2019t connect or shows errors. Is there a fix?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If your Android app shows failure messages when you\u2019re trying to perform actions, please try emptying the local Letterboxd app cache in Android\u2019s Settings area. You may also need to sign out, then sign in again after emptying the cache. If this solution doesn\u2019t remedy the issue, please try deleting and reinstalling the app from the Play Store.\r\nPlease also note that our API authentication layer requires that your device\u2019s time and time zone match each other. If your country or area has changed or cancelled its daylight savings approach, you\u2019ll need to change your device time zone to that of a location with the correct time, rather than manually adjusting your device\u2019s local time by an hour."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why don\u2019t images load on my Android (or other old) device?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our CDN provider requires TLS 1.2 to load image assets. Some older devices (including several Android handsets) don\u2019t support this security protocol and therefore aren\u2019t able to load our image assets. Please contact your handset or tablet manufacturer for upgraded OS libraries that support this security protocol."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"When I first opened your iOS app, it showed me a full-screen poster view. How can I get back to that?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"This mode is called Carousel view, and is available in our apps when viewing a list or any of the sections in the Search/Browse by tab. Depending on the view you\u2019re in, Carousel view can be launched from an icon (it\u2019s a \u201ccoverflow\u201d-style depiction of three posters, with the center poster in front) or from the ellipsis menu if you\u2019re on a list (as \u201cView in Carousel mode\u201d). Carousel mode can be used in conjunction with sorting and filters; for example: engage the Hide watched films filter to skip films you\u2019ve already marked or logged."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Someone else has access to my account. Have you been hacked?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. The most common method used by an attacker to gain access to another person\u2019s account (on any online service that supports sign-ins) is to find the account owner\u2019s credentials in a \u201cdata leak\u201d and use them to change the account password and/or delete the account. Data leaks can occur when an online service\u2019s servers or datastore are compromised by an attacker, and the contents published online. The best defense against such an attack is to use unique, complex passwords for each different service you join.\r\nLetterboxd requires the account password for email address changes and account deactivations, among other actions. If you believe your Letterboxd account has been compromised by an attacker, please get in touch with us at your earliest convenience and we will do our best to restore access for you. (In cases where permanent deletion has been requested and actioned for a deactivated account, we are unable to restore access.)"}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I embed content from Letterboxd into my site?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"We have previously conducted a pilot program where selected partners were able to show a summary of Letterboxd activity for a film on their websites. Recent changes to browser security policy have limited our ability to customize content embeds, because we can no longer determine if the visitor to the third-party website is signed in to a Letterboxd account (required to show their rating or their friends\u2019 activity, etc). We are not accepting new content-embed partners at this time. It\u2019s possible we might look at embeddable reviews and/or lists in the future, but this facility is not available today."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I use your logo on my site, video or elsewhere?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, provided you do so respectfully. You\u2019ll find versions for download here."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why is the logo on your website bleeding?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"What started as a Hallowe\u2019en gag is now a permanent feature: if you browse the Horror genre on our site, or visit the profile of a Pro member that mentions #horror in their bio, or you just live horror, you\u2019ll see this effect."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why doesn\u2019t Letterboxd support old browsers?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It takes time and effort to support legacy browsers, and we\u2019d rather spend that time watching films."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Letterboxd is missing a vital feature! Who should I tell?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Please direct your feedback here. We are continually improving our platform and would welcome your thoughts on the service\u2019s future direction."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Where should I report a security vulnerability?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Please email us if you have discovered a security flaw in Letterboxd."}}],"@type":"FAQPage","@context":"http://schema.org"}
